description: Language models for controlling web search and Python interpreters

# Tool Use

For most real-world applications, language models will have to access information by controlling tools—doing web searches, checking your calendar, looking up emails, or running calculations. We’ll look at two examples here:

1. [Running web searches using Google](web-search.md)
2. [Executing computations using the Python interpreter](interpreters.md)

In both cases, we’ll extend [the basic question-answerer](../question-answering/q-and-a-about-short-texts.md).
