# Iterative action selection

For non-trivial questions it's generally not enough to take a single cognitive action. For example, consider:

```
What is the log10 of the number of people living in the US vs China?
```

Ideally we'd first look up the populations, then compute the logarithms.

Alas, this chapter hasn't been written yet.

## Exercise

Implement iterative action selection. If you need inspiration, take a look at this execution trace:

For even more inspiration, take a look at [sequential\_action.py](https://github.com/oughtinc/ice/blob/main/ice/recipes/primer/sequential\_action.py) in the ICE repository.
