# Iterative action selection

For non-trivial questions it's generally not enough to take a single cognitive action. For example, consider:

```
What is the log10 of the number of people living in the US vs China?
```

Ideally we'd first look up the populations, then compute the logs.

Alas, this chapter hasn't been written yet.
