# Checking answers

Let’s start with the simplest possible way of verifying an answer—just ask the model whether it’s correct. Our recipe:

{% code title="verify_answer.py" %}
```python
from ice.recipe import recipe


def make_verification_prompt(question: str, answer: str) -> str:
    return f"""Consider this question: "{question}"

Potential answer: "{answer}"

Q: Is the potential answer above correct? Say "A: Yes" or "A: No".
A:"""


async def verify_answer(question: str, answer: str) -> float:
    prompt = make_verification_prompt(question=question, answer=answer)
    choice_probs, _ = await recipe.agent().classify(
        prompt=prompt, choices=(" Yes", " No")
    )
    return choice_probs.get(" Yes", 0)


recipe.main(verify_answer)
```
{% endcode %}

The interesting bit here is that we don’t just want a boolean Yes/No answer from the model, but that we want the probability of the “Yes” answer to the correctness question. This way, we get a more graded signal that we can use, e.g., to only show or use model responses when they exceed a threshold.

## Sanity checks

Let’s test it:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```shell
python verify_answer.py --question "What is 2 + 2?" --answer "4"
```
{% endcode %}

```
0.9948396822920341
```

Good.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
python verify_answer.py --question "What is 2 + 2?" --answer "5"
```
{% endcode %}

```
0.0010152581398344962
```

Basic sanity checks pass.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```shell
python verify_answer.py --question "What is the capital of Germany?" --answer "Munich"
```
{% endcode %}

```
0.0005455832226911594
```

Also correct.

## A math problem

Let’s try something harder: A problem from the GSM8K math problems dataset:

> Beth bakes 4x 2 dozen batches of cookies in a week. If these cookies are shared amongst 16 people equally, how many cookies does each person consume?

The correct answer is 6, but it takes a few steps of reasoning to work that out.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```shell
python verify_answer.py --question "Beth bakes 4x 2 dozen batches of cookies in a week. If these cookies are shared amongst 16 people equally, how many cookies does each person consume?" --answer "6"
```
{% endcode %}

```
0.06723949284762187
```

The model can’t see that the answer is correct.

What if we also give the reasoning steps?

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```shell
python verify_answer.py --question "Beth bakes 4x 2 dozen batches of cookies in a week. If these cookies are shared amongst 16 people equally, how many cookies does each person consume?" --answer "Beth bakes 4x 2 dozen batches of cookies for a total of 4*2 = 8 dozen cookies. There are 12 cookies in a dozen and she makes 8 dozen cookies for a total of 12*8 = 96 cookies. She splits the 96 cookies equally amongst 16 people so they each eat 96/16 = 6 cookies. So, the final answer is 6 cookies per person."
```
{% endcode %}

```
0.3231381082881086
```

Now the answer is judged to be more likely to be correct, but still less than 50% correct. What if we check the answer step by step?
