# Verifiers

It’s often easier to tell whether a solution is correct than to come up with it. We can use this to improve the quality of responses. As a first step, let’s use it to check the quality of responses. We’ll try two versions:

1. Just ask the model: [Is this solution correct?](checking-answers.md)
2. Given a list of reasoning steps, ask the model: [For each step, is it correct?](checking-reasoning-steps.md)
