# Factored Cognition Primer

You'll learn how to:

* Amplify language model reasoning through recursive question-answering and debate
* Reason about long texts by combining search and generation
* Run decompositions quickly by parallelizing language model calls
* Build human-in-the-loop agents
* Use verification of answers and reasoning steps to improve responses
* And more!

The book focuses on techniques that are likely to remain relevant for better language models.
