# Factored Cognition Primer

In this tutorial we'll get language models like GTP-3 to do complex reasoning tasks by composing together many reasoning steps.

You'll learn how to:

* Amplify language model reasoning through recursive question-answering and debate
* Reason about long texts by combining search and generation
* Run decomposition recipes quickly by parallelizing language model calls
* Quickly debug recipes by zooming in on failures
* Interface with different kinds of language models
* Build human-in-the-loop agents
