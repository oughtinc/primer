# Factored Cognition Primer

Learn how to use language models like GPT-3 for complex reasoning tasks by composing together many reasoning steps.

You'll see how to:

* Amplify language model reasoning through recursive question-answering and debate
* Reason about long texts by combining search and generation
* Run decompositions quickly by parallelizing language model calls
* Debug recipes by zooming in on failures
* Interface with different kinds of language models
* Build human-in-the-loop agents
