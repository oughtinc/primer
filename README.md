# Factored Cognition Primer

You'll learn how to:

* Amplify language model reasoning through recursive question-answering and debate
* Reason about long texts by combining search and generation
* Run decompositions quickly by parallelizing language model calls
* Debug recipes by zooming in on failures
* Interface with different kinds of language models
* Build human-in-the-loop agents
* Use verification of answers and reasoning steps to improve responses

The book focuses on techniques that are likely to remain relevant for better language models, and perhaps will even become more useful.
