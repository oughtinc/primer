description: How to install and run the Interaction Composition Explorer

# Before We Start

The recipes in this primer are implemented using the [Interactive Composition Explorer](https://github.com/oughtinc/ice) (ICE). If youâ€™d like to follow along with the implementation (strongly recommended), set it up first.

## Requirements

ICE requires Python 3.10. If you only have newer or older version(s) of Python installed, we recommend using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to install Python 3.10 and manage multiple Python versions.

If you use Windows, you'll need to run ICE inside of [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

## Run ICE

As part of general good Python practice, consider first creating and activating a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to avoid installing ICE 'globally'. For example:

```shell
python3.10 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install ICE:

```shell
pip install ought-ice
```

Obtain an [`OPENAI_API_KEY`](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) and create an `.env` file containing it in the ICE folder:

{% code title="~/.ought-ice/.env" %}

```shell
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...f8 # Replace with your API key.
```

{% endcode %}

Start the ICE server in its own terminal and leave it running:

```shell
python -m ice.server
```
